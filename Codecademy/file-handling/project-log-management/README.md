# Go File Handling Project: Log Management System

In this project, we will practice our knowledge of file handling in Go. We will develop the Log Management System application where users can conduct directory and file operations. To finish this application, we used the following file-handling techniques in Go:

 - create log files
 - read log files
 - write to log files
 - create directories
 - change the working directory
 - proper error handling

Youâ€™ll notice four files present in the workspace. Here's what they do:

`file_operations.go`: Go file for conducting file-based operations
`directory_operations.go`: Go file for conducting directory-based operations
`main.go`: Go file for executing the application and collecting user input
`go.mod`: File for indicating how to run the application

To run the application, run go run `.`

To stop executing the application, press `control` and `c` on your keyboard at the same time.
